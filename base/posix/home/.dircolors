# Below are the color init strings for the basic file types. A color init

# Background color codes:
# 40=black 41=red 42=green 43=yellow 44=blue 45=magenta 46=cyan 47=white

NORMAL 00 # global default, although everything should be something.
FILE 00 # normal file
DIR 01;34 # directory
LINK 01;36 # symbolic link. (If you set this to 'target' instead of a
# numerical value, the color is as for the file pointed to.)

FIFO 40;33 # pipe
SOCK 01;35 # socket
DOOR 01;35 # door
BLK 40;33;01 # block device driver
CHR 40;33;01 # character device driver
ORPHAN 00 # symlink to nonexistent file, or non-stat'able file
SETUID 00 # file that is setuid (u+s)
SETGID 00 # file that is setgid (g+s)

STICKY_OTHER_WRITABLE 01;34 # dir that is sticky and other-writable (+t,o+w)
OTHER_WRITABLE 01;34 # dir that is other-writable (o+w) and not sticky
STICKY 01;34 # dir with the sticky bit set (+t) and not other-writable
